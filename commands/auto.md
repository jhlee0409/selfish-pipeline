# /selfish:auto — Full Auto Pipeline

> Runs spec → plan → tasks → implement → review → clean fully automatically from a single feature description.
> No intermediate confirmation. clarify/analyze are skipped. Critic Loop is performed automatically at each phase.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — (required) Feature description in natural language

## Project Config (auto-loaded)

!`cat .claude/selfish.config.md 2>/dev/null || echo "[CONFIG NOT FOUND] .claude/selfish.config.md not found. Create it with /selfish:init."`

## Config Load

**Always** read `.claude/selfish.config.md` first (read manually if not auto-loaded above). Values defined in this file are referenced below as `{config.*}`:
- `{config.ci}` — full CI command
- `{config.gate}` — phase gate command
- `{config.architecture}` — architecture style and rules
- `{config.framework}` — framework characteristics (server/client boundary etc.)
- `{config.code_style}` — code style rules
- `{config.risks}` — project-specific risk patterns
- `{config.mini_review}` — Mini-Review checklist items

If config file is missing: print "`.claude/selfish.config.md` not found. Create project config with `/selfish:init`." then **abort**.

---

## Critic Loop Rules (common to all phases)

> **Always** read `docs/critic-loop-rules.md` first and follow it.
> Core: minimum 1 concern per criterion + mandatory Adversarial failure scenario each pass + quantitative evidence required. "PASS" as a single word is prohibited.

---

## Execution Steps

### Phase 0: Preparation

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty → print "Please enter a feature description." and abort
2. Check current branch → `BRANCH_NAME`
3. Determine feature name (2-3 keywords → kebab-case)
3.5. **Preflight Check**:
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-preflight-check.sh"
   ```
   - If exit 1 (hard failure) → print error and **abort**
   - If warnings only (exit 0) → print warnings and continue
4. **Activate Pipeline Flag** (hook integration):
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" start {feature}
   ```
   - Safety Snapshot created automatically (`selfish/pre-auto` git tag)
   - Stop Gate Hook activated (blocks response termination on CI failure)
   - File change tracking started
   - Timeline log: `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" log pipeline-start "Auto pipeline: {feature}"`
5. Create `specs/{feature}/` directory → **record path as `PIPELINE_ARTIFACT_DIR`** (for Clean scope)
6. Start notification:
   ```
   Auto pipeline started: {feature}
   ├─ 1/6 Spec → 2/6 Plan → 3/6 Tasks → 4/6 Implement → 5/6 Review → 6/6 Clean
   └─ Running fully automatically (no intermediate confirmation)
   ```

### Phase 1: Spec (1/6)

`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase spec`

Execute `/selfish:spec` logic inline:

1. Explore codebase for related code (Glob, Grep) — explore by `{config.architecture}` layer
2. Create `specs/{feature}/spec.md`
3. `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items are **auto-resolved with best-guess** (clarify skipped)
   - Tag auto-resolved items with `[AUTO-RESOLVED]`
4. **Critic Loop 1 pass** (follow Critic Loop rules):
   - COMPLETENESS: does every User Story have acceptance scenarios? Any missing requirements?
   - MEASURABILITY: are success criteria measurable, not subjective? **Is quantitative evidence provided for numerical targets?**
   - INDEPENDENCE: are implementation details (code, library names) absent from the spec?
   - EDGE_CASES: are at least 2 identified? Any missing boundary conditions?
   - FAIL items → auto-fix and update spec.md
5. Progress: `✓ 1/6 Spec complete (US: {N}, FR: {N}, Critic: {FAIL count} fixed)`

### Phase 2: Plan (2/6)

`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase plan`

Execute `/selfish:plan` logic inline:

1. Load spec.md
2. If technical uncertainties exist → auto-resolve via WebSearch/code exploration → create research.md
3. Create `specs/{feature}/plan.md`
   - **If setting numerical targets (line counts etc.), include structure-analysis-based estimates** (e.g., "function A ~50 lines, component B ~80 lines → total ~130 lines")
4. **Critic Loop 3 passes** (follow Critic Loop rules):
   - Criteria: COMPLETENESS, FEASIBILITY, ARCHITECTURE, RISK, PRINCIPLES
   - **RISK criterion mandatory checks**:
     - Enumerate **at least 3** `{config.ci}` failure scenarios and describe mitigation
     - Check each pattern in `{config.risks}` one by one
     - Consider `{config.framework}` characteristics (server/client boundary etc.)
   - **ARCHITECTURE criterion**: explicitly describe import paths for moved/created files and pre-validate against `{config.architecture}` rules
   - Each pass must **explicitly explore what was missed in the previous pass** ("Pass 2: {X} was missed in pass 1. Further review: ...")
5. Progress: `✓ 2/6 Plan complete (Critic: {total FAIL fixes}, files: {N})`

### Phase 3: Tasks (3/6)

`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase tasks`

Execute `/selfish:tasks` logic inline:

1. Load plan.md
2. Decompose tasks by phase (T001, T002, ...)
3. **[P] marker and dependency rules**:
   - Assign `[P]` marker to independent tasks with no overlapping file paths
   - Use explicit `depends: [TXXX]` for cross-task dependencies (replaces informal `(after TXXX)`)
   - Validate dependency graph is a DAG (no circular references)
   - [P] tasks **must be executed in parallel** in Phase 4 (declaring [P] then running sequentially is prohibited)
4. Coverage mapping (FR → Task)
5. **Critic Loop 1 pass** (follow Critic Loop rules):
   - COVERAGE: is every FR/NFR mapped to at least 1 task?
   - DEPENDENCIES: is the dependency graph a valid DAG? Do [P] tasks have no file overlaps?
6. Create `specs/{feature}/tasks.md`
7. Progress: `✓ 3/6 Tasks complete (tasks: {N}, parallel: {N})`

### Phase 4: Implement (4/6)

`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase implement`

Execute `/selfish:implement` logic inline with **dependency-aware orchestration**:

1. Parse tasks.md — extract task IDs, [P] markers, `depends:` lists, file paths
2. Build dependency graph per phase (validate DAG)
3. **Orchestration mode selection** (per phase, automatic):

   | [P] tasks in phase | Mode | Strategy |
   |---------------------|------|----------|
   | 0 | Sequential | Execute tasks one by one |
   | 1–5 | Parallel Batch | Register tasks → set dependencies → launch Task() calls |
   | 6+ | Swarm | Task pool + self-organizing worker agents (max 5 workers) |

4. **Parallel Batch mode** (1–5 [P] tasks):
   ```
   TaskCreate({ subject: "T012: Move AudioFadeControl", ... })
   TaskCreate({ subject: "T013: Move AudioVolumeControl", ... })
   TaskUpdate({ taskId: "T013", addBlockedBy: ["T011"] })  // if dependency exists
   → launch unblocked tasks as parallel Task() calls in a single message
   → read results → launch newly-unblocked → repeat until phase complete
   ```

5. **Swarm mode** (6+ [P] tasks):
   ```
   // 1. Register all phase tasks via TaskCreate
   // 2. Set up dependencies via TaskUpdate(addBlockedBy)
   // 3. Spawn N worker agents (N = min(5, unblocked count))
   Task("Swarm Worker 1", subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     prompt: "Self-organizing worker: TaskList → claim → implement → complete → repeat until empty")
   Task("Swarm Worker 2", ...)
   // 4. Workers self-balance — fast workers claim more tasks
   // 5. Read all worker results before proceeding to gate
   ```

6. Perform **3-step gate** on each Implementation Phase completion — **always** read `docs/phase-gate-protocol.md` first. Cannot advance to next phase without passing the gate.
   - On gate pass: create phase rollback point `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase-tag {phase_number}`
7. Real-time `[x]` updates in tasks.md
8. After full completion, run `{config.ci}` final verification
   - On pass: `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" ci-pass` (releases Stop Gate)
9. **Implement retrospective**: if unexpected problems arose that weren't predicted in Plan, record in `specs/{feature}/retrospective.md` (for memory update in Clean)
10. Progress: `✓ 4/6 Implement complete ({completed}/{total} tasks, CI: ✓, Mini-Review: ✓, Checkpoint: ✓)`

### Phase 5: Review (5/6)

`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase review`

Execute `/selfish:review` logic inline:

1. Review implemented changed files (`git diff HEAD`)
2. Check code quality, `{config.architecture}` rules, security, performance, `{config.code_style}` pattern compliance
3. **Critic Loop 1 pass** (follow Critic Loop rules):
   - COMPLETENESS: cross-check every SC (success criterion) from spec.md one by one. Provide specific metrics if falling short.
   - PRECISION: are there unnecessary changes? Are there out-of-scope modifications?
4. **Handling SC shortfalls**:
   - Fixable → attempt auto-fix → re-run `{config.ci}` verification
   - Not fixable → state in final report with reason (no post-hoc rationalization; record as Plan-phase target-setting error)
5. Progress: `✓ 5/6 Review complete (Critical:{N} Warning:{N} Info:{N}, SC shortfalls: {N})`

### Phase 6: Clean (6/6)

`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" phase clean`

Artifact cleanup and codebase hygiene check after implementation and review:

1. **Artifact cleanup** (scope-limited):
   - **Delete only the `specs/{feature}/` directory created by the current pipeline**
   - If other `specs/` subdirectories exist, **do not delete them** (only inform the user of their existence)
   - Do not leave pipeline intermediate artifacts in the codebase
2. **Dead code scan**:
   - Detect unused imports from the implementation process (check with `{config.ci}`)
   - Remove empty directories from moved/deleted files
   - Detect unused exports (re-exports of moved code from original locations etc.)
3. **Final CI gate**:
   - Run `{config.ci}` final execution
   - Auto-fix on failure (max 2 attempts)
4. **Memory update** (if applicable):
   - Reusable patterns found during pipeline → record in `memory/`
   - If there were `[AUTO-RESOLVED]` items → record decisions in `memory/decisions/`
   - **If retrospective.md exists** → record as patterns missed by the Plan phase Critic Loop in `memory/retrospectives/` (reuse as RISK checklist items in future runs)
   - **If review-report.md exists** → copy to `memory/reviews/{feature}-{date}.md` before specs/ deletion
5. **Checkpoint reset**:
   - Clear `memory/checkpoint.md` (pipeline complete = session goal achieved)
6.5. **Timeline finalize**:
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" log pipeline-end "Pipeline complete: {feature}"
   ```
6. **Release Pipeline Flag** (hook integration):
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/selfish-pipeline-manage.sh" end
   ```
   - Stop Gate Hook deactivated
   - Change tracking log deleted
   - Safety tag removed (successful completion)
   - Phase rollback tags removed (handled automatically by pipeline end)
7. Progress: `✓ 6/6 Clean complete (deleted: {N}, dead code: {N}, CI: ✓)`

### Final Output

```
Auto pipeline complete: {feature}
├─ Spec: US {N}, FR {N}
├─ Plan: Critic {FAIL fixes}, research {present/absent}
├─ Tasks: {total} (parallel {N})
├─ Implement: {completed}/{total} tasks, CI ✓, Checkpoint ✓
├─ Review: Critical:{N} Warning:{N} Info:{N}, SC shortfalls: {N}
├─ Clean: {N} artifacts deleted, {N} dead code removed
├─ Changed files: {N}
├─ Auto-resolved: {N} (review recommended)
├─ Retrospective: {present/absent}
└─ specs/{feature}/ cleaned up
```

## Abort Conditions

**Abort** the pipeline and report to user in these situations:

1. `{config.ci}` fails 3 consecutive times
2. File conflict during implementation (overlaps with changes from another branch)
3. Critical security issue found (cannot auto-fix)

On abort:
```
Pipeline aborted (Phase {N}/6)
├─ Reason: {abort cause}
├─ Completed phases: {completed list}
├─ Rollback: git reset --hard selfish/pre-auto (restores state before implementation)
├─ Checkpoint: memory/checkpoint.md (last phase gate passed)
├─ Artifacts: specs/{feature}/ (partial completion, manual deletion needed if Clean did not run)
└─ Resume: /selfish:resume → /selfish:implement (checkpoint-based)
```

## Notes

- **Full auto**: runs to completion without intermediate confirmation. Fast but direction cannot be changed mid-run.
- **Review auto-resolved items**: items tagged `[AUTO-RESOLVED]` are estimates; review after the fact is recommended.
- **Large feature warning**: warn before starting if more than 5 User Stories are expected.
- **Read existing code first**: always read existing files before modifying. Do not blindly generate code.
- **Follow project rules**: project rules in `selfish.config.md` and `CLAUDE.md` take priority.
- **Critic Loop is not a ritual**: a single "PASS" line is equivalent to not running Critic at all. Always follow the format in the Critic Loop rules section.
- **[P] parallel is mandatory**: if a [P] marker is assigned in tasks.md, it must be executed in parallel. Orchestration mode (batch vs swarm) is selected automatically based on task count. Sequential substitution is prohibited.
- **Swarm mode is automatic**: when a phase has 6+ [P] tasks, swarm workers self-organize via TaskList/TaskUpdate. Do not manually batch.
- **No out-of-scope deletion**: do not delete files/directories in Clean that were not created by the current pipeline.
- **NEVER use `run_in_background: true` on Task calls**: agents must run in foreground so results are returned before the next step.
