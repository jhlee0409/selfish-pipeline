# /selfish:plan — Implementation Design

> Generates an implementation plan (plan.md) based on the feature specification (spec.md).
> Ensures quality with 3 Critic Loop passes and runs research in parallel when needed.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — (optional) Additional context or constraints

## Project Config (auto-loaded)

!`cat .claude/selfish.config.md 2>/dev/null || echo "[CONFIG NOT FOUND] .claude/selfish.config.md not found. Create it with /selfish:init."`

## Config Load

**Always** read `.claude/selfish.config.md` first (read manually if not auto-loaded above). Abort if config file is missing.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Load Context

1. Check **current branch** → `BRANCH_NAME`
2. Find **specs/{feature}/spec.md**:
   - Search under `specs/` for a directory matching the current branch name or `$ARGUMENTS`
   - If not found: print "spec.md not found. Run `/selfish:spec` first." then **abort**
3. Read full **spec.md**
4. Read **memory/principles.md** (if present)
5. Read **CLAUDE.md** project context

### 2. Clarification Check

- If spec.md contains `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` tags:
  - Warn user: "There are unresolved clarification items. Do you want to continue?"
  - If user chooses to stop → guide to `/selfish:clarify` then **abort**

### 3. Phase 0 — Research (if needed)

Extract technical uncertainties from spec.md:

1. Are there libraries/APIs not yet used?
2. Are performance requirements unverified?
3. Is the integration approach with the existing codebase unclear?

**If there are uncertain items**:
- Resolve each via WebSearch/codebase exploration
- Record results in `specs/{feature}/research.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## {topic}
  **Decision**: {chosen approach}
  **Rationale**: {reason}
  **Alternatives**: {other approaches considered}
  **Source**: {URL or file path}
  ```

**If no uncertain items**: skip Phase 0.

### 4. Phase 1 — Write Design

Create `specs/{feature}/plan.md`. **Must** follow the structure below:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {feature name}

## Summary
{summary of core requirements from spec + technical approach, 3-5 sentences}

## Technical Context
{summary of project settings loaded from selfish.config.md}
- **Language**: {config.code_style.language}
- **Framework**: {config.framework.name}
- **State**: {config.state_management summary}
- **Architecture**: {config.architecture.style}
- **Styling**: {config.styling.framework}
- **Testing**: {config.testing.framework}
- **Constraints**: {constraints extracted from spec}

## Principles Check
{if memory/principles.md exists: validation results against MUST principles}
{if violations possible: state explicitly + justification}

## Architecture Decision
### Approach
{core idea of the chosen design}

### Architecture Placement
| Layer | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| {entities/features/widgets/shared} | {path} | {description} |

### State Management Strategy
{what combination of Zustand store / React Query / Context is used where}

### API Design
{plan for new API endpoints or use of existing APIs}

## File Change Map
{list of files to change/create. for each file:}
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| {path} | create/modify/delete | {summary of change} |

## Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| {risk} | {H/M/L} | {approach} |

## Alternative Design
### Approach A: {chosen approach name}
{Brief description — this is the approach detailed above}

### Approach B: {alternative approach name}
{Brief description of a meaningfully different approach}

| Criterion | Approach A | Approach B |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Complexity | {evaluation} | {evaluation} |
| Risk | {evaluation} | {evaluation} |
| Maintainability | {evaluation} | {evaluation} |

**Decision**: Approach {A/B} — {1-sentence rationale}

## Phase Breakdown
### Phase 1: Setup
{project structure, type definitions, configuration}

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
{core business logic, state management}

### Phase 3: UI & Integration
{UI components, API integration}

### Phase 4: Polish
{error handling, performance optimization, tests}
```

### 5. Critic Loop (3 passes)

> **Always** read `docs/critic-loop-rules.md` first and follow it.

After drafting plan.md, perform **up to 3 self-critique passes**.

Validate against these 5 criteria each pass:

| Criterion | Validation |
|-----------|------------|
| **COMPLETENESS** | Are all requirements (FR-*) from spec.md reflected in the plan? |
| **FEASIBILITY** | Is it compatible with the existing codebase? Are dependencies available? |
| **ARCHITECTURE** | Does it comply with {config.architecture} rules? |
| **RISK** | Are there any unidentified risks? Additionally, if `memory/retrospectives/` directory contains files from previous pipeline runs, load each file and check whether the current plan addresses the patterns recorded there. Tag matched patterns with `[RETRO-CHECKED]`. |
| **PRINCIPLES** | Does it not violate the MUST principles in principles.md? |

**Output rules**:
- **If there are FAIL items**: display `⚠ {criterion}: {issue summary}. Fixing...` → update plan.md → proceed to next pass
- **If no FAIL items**: display `✓ Critic {N}/3 passed`
- **Final**: `Critic Loop complete ({N} passes). Key changes: {change summary}` or `Critic Loop complete (1 pass). No changes.`

### 6. Agent Teams (if needed)

If research items are 3 or more, delegate to parallel research agents via Task tool:

```
Task("Research: {topic1}", subagent_type: "general-purpose")
Task("Research: {topic2}", subagent_type: "general-purpose")
→ collect results → consolidate into research.md
```

### 7. Final Output

```
Plan generated
├─ specs/{feature}/plan.md
├─ specs/{feature}/research.md (if research was performed)
├─ Critic: {N} passes, key changes: {summary}
└─ Next step: /selfish:tasks
```

## Notes

- Write plan.md to an **actionable level**. Vague expressions like "handle appropriately" are prohibited.
- File paths in the File Change Map must be based on the **actual project structure** (no guessing).
- Place files according to {config.architecture} rules; verify by checking existing codebase patterns.
- If there is a conflict with CLAUDE.md project settings, CLAUDE.md takes priority.
