# /selfish:debug — Bug Diagnosis and Fix

> Analyzes the root cause of a bug and fixes it.
> Validates the safety and accuracy of the fix with 2 Critic Loop passes.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — (required) Bug description, error message, or reproduction steps

## Config Load

**Always** read `.claude/selfish.config.md` first. Abort if config file is missing.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Gather Information

1. Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - **Symptom**: what is going wrong?
   - **Reproduction conditions**: when does it occur?
   - **Error message**: full text if available
   - **Expected behavior**: what should happen?

2. Ask user for additional information if needed (max 2 questions)

### 2. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Proceed in order:

1. **Error trace**: extract file:line from error message/stack trace → read that code
2. **Data flow**: trace backwards from the problem point (where did the bad data come in?)
3. **State analysis**: check relevant {config.state_management} cache state
4. **Recent changes**: check recent changes with `git log --oneline -10 -- {related files}`
5. **Race conditions**: check for timing issues between async operations

### 3. Form Hypotheses

List possible causes as a **hypothesis list**:

```markdown
### Hypotheses
1. **[High probability]** {cause1}: {evidence}
2. **[Medium probability]** {cause2}: {evidence}
3. **[Low probability]** {cause3}: {evidence}
```

Verify starting from highest probability.

### 4. Implement Fix

1. **Minimal change principle**: change only the minimum code required to fix the bug
2. **Impact analysis**: verify what effect the fix has on other code
3. **Apply fix**

### 5. Critic Loop (2 passes)

> **Always** read `docs/critic-loop-rules.md` first and follow it.

| Criterion | Validation |
|-----------|------------|
| **SAFETY** | Does the fix break any other functionality? Any side effects? |
| **CORRECTNESS** | Does it actually resolve the root cause? Or just mask the symptom? |

On FAIL:
- SAFETY fail → check and fix impacted code
- CORRECTNESS fail → revisit hypotheses, move to next hypothesis

### 6. Verification

```bash
{config.gate}
```

Retry after fixing on failure (max 3 attempts).

### 7. Final Output

```
Debug complete
├─ Root cause: {one-line summary}
├─ Fixed files: {file list}
├─ Critic: {N} passes complete
├─ Verified: typecheck + lint passed
└─ Impact scope: {affected components/features}
```

## Debugging Checklist (applied automatically)

Always check the Debugging Checklist from CLAUDE.md:
1. Race Conditions — contention between async operations
2. Stale State — stale state references
3. Missing Error Handling — missing Promise .catch()
4. Incorrect Ordering — operation order dependencies
5. Boundary Conditions — edge case handling

## Notes

- **No excessive changes**: change only what is needed to fix the bug. Do not refactor surrounding code.
- **Symptom vs cause**: find the root cause, not the surface symptom.
- **3-attempt limit**: if fix fails after 3 attempts, report the situation to the user.
